## What is TreeGen?

TreeGen is a desktop application designed to help researchers and data curators visualize, describe, and export the structure of folders and files in a research dataset. It offers a simple and dynamic interface to:

- Browse a directory and display its content as a tree.
- Add textual descriptions to each file or folder.
- Filter out hidden files and unwanted file types.
- Export the documented structure as a Markdown or plain text file.

::: {.callout-note}
We designed a desktop application because some datasets can be very large to handle online.

## Getting Started

### Download executable files:

**Windows users:** Download and run the .exe file located in the [dist](https://github.com/Alliance-RDM-GDR/RDM_FileTree/tree/main/dist) folder.

**Mac (M1) users:** Download the .app app file located in the [dist](https://github.com/Alliance-RDM-GDR/RDM_FileTree/tree/main/dist) folder.

### Run script

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
- [humanize](https://pypi.org/project/humanize/)

_Optional (for converting Markdown to HTML in the preview, if needed):_

- [Markdown](https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/)

#### Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 humanize
# Optional:
pip install markdown
```

#### Clone the [Repository](https://github.com/Alliance-RDM-GDR/RDM_FileTree)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alliance-RDM-GDR/RDM_FileTree
cd file-tree-generator
```
#### Run the application in terminal with:

```bash
python TreeGen.py
```

## How to use the app

### 1. Launch TreeGen

Double-click the application executable or run the script. The main window displays the instructions, and two panels: the **file tree** and the **preview/export area**.

### 2. Select a directory

Click **Select Directory** and choose the folder you wish to document. The file tree will populate with its contents.

### 3. Add descriptions

Double-click on the **Description** column to annotate/descripbe any file or folder. Descriptions are automatically saved in a hidden `.descriptions.json` file.

::: {.callout-tip}
Provide a simple description that shows the contents of the file. In addition, use README files or [codebooks](https://alliance-rdm-gdr.github.io/RDM_Codebook_App/) to provide specific information, including context, methods, and description of variables. 
:::

### 4. Use filters (optional)

- **Search bar**: Find specific files or folders by name.  
- **Exclude extensions**: Type comma-separated extensions (e.g., `.tmp, .pyc`) to hide from view.  
- **Exclude hidden**: Toggle visibility of hidden files and folders.

### 5. Export the file tree

Use the top buttons to export the tree:

- **Markdown (.md)**: Suitable for GitHub, README files, and research documentation.
- **Plain Text (.txt)**: Readable in any text editor.

Both formats include:
- Indented folder/file tree
- File sizes
- Inline comments with your descriptions
- A summary section

## Example Output
